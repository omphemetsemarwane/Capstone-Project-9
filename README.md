# Machine Learning: Polynomial Regression
# Project information:
# Description

Polynomial regression is a special case of multiple linear regression that adds terms with degrees greater than one to the model. Polynomial regression is used to find a relationship between two variables. In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the
independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y

# Features(How it works)

The main concept to find relationships using Polynomial regression is to find the relationship between different degrees of polynomial regressor using accuracy, variance, and bias

# Contributers

I worked on this project on my own and it was reviewed and commented on by my mentor at Hyperion Development
